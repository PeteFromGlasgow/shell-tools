Shell Tools
===========

Just some really quick and dirty shell tools written in bash for doing some really quick and simple tasks. They don't do anything cool, aren't very well written and have practically no value but they work.

diary, diary_view, diary_all
----------------------------

One liner that allows you to log things that happen and at what time when on a box. It stores a file per day so its easy to look at individual days.


idea, idea_all, idea_view
-------------------------

Like the above command this stores text timestamp in a file, in this case however the text will be stored in a file set by the first argument.
